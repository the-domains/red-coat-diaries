# What is being said about Red Coat Diaries True Stories from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police:

"I am very pleased to endorse " Red Coat Diaries - The Ladies Sequel" which continues to document the remarkable and very unique stories that our female members (and spouses) have experienced in the Force since 1974\. My own journey in the RCMP began in 1982 and the stories chronicled in this book not only remind me of my own experiences (and challenges) but have also reminded me of how far we have come as a large para-military organization comprised of men and women who are proud to serve and protect Canadians every day. Some of the stories I heard from the women who joined prior to me as well as the female members whom I have worked with since, have actually inspired me in my career to try to influence positive change not just for female members but also for the Force so that we are the "world class organization" we know Canadians are proud of. I know I am not only proud of the women in the RCMP who have contributed their time and experiences to this book but also to stand should-to-shoulder with all of the women who have chosen to play an important role in the history of Canada's national police force." 

-- Deputy Commissioner Marianne Ryan , Royal Canadian Mounted Police

"In a time where police services across Canada are having difficulty recruiting women I found this book to be extremely motivating in promoting policing as a profession.  The women in this book tell you stories of camaraderie and teamwork and how moments of their career have left a positive and lasting impression because of the type of work that the men and women in law enforcement do each and every day.  It motivates you to join the ranks to make a difference in your community.  I encourage you to not only read the book but to consider policing as a career."

--Chief Jennifer Evans, Peel Regional Police
